![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13123651/33057348-721373ec-ce58-11e7-9e32-cfd371d7e86e.jpg)

## Description:
This course provides a theory-centric introduction to Reinforcement Learning. Students will learn the key concepts and algorithms driving Reinforcement Learning, including Markov Decision Processes, Monte Carlo Learning, and Policy Gradient methods. The course will culminate in a final reinforcement-learning project built on OpenAI Gym that will be presented to the class.

## Grading: 
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department <a href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu/">grades server</a>.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ---------- | -----|-------- |
| 80% | Problem Sets  | Weekly, short problem sets that test key concepts covered in lecture. |
| 20% | Project | Final project to demonstrate mastery of topics learned and apply knowledge to create a reinforcement learning project in a new OpenAI environment. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered afterwards.

## Problem Sets
Since the course will introduce students to new topics that many will not have previous exposure to, it is essential that students complete a weekly problem set to ensure they understand key concepts of each weekâ€™s lecture. Each problem set is designed to take 20 minutes on average to complete.

## Projects
We will be working on an in-class project to create an AI for a simple Pong game, and build upon this example throughout the class (until Week 13). Since we will be working on this project together in class, no grade will be assigned, but students are responsible for understanding the underlying concepts, which will be used when developing the final project. 

The only project the students will code themselves is the final project, using OpenAI Gym. They can pick a game or simulation of their choosing, and we will approve based on feasibility and available resources. We will be holding office hours throughout the week(s) of the final project for assistance.

## Communication:
We will interact with students in-person during office hours and online via Piazza

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
