# CMSC389R: Reinforcement Learning

Credits: 1

## Description:
This course provides an overview of the key concepts and algorithms of Reinforcement Learning, an area of artificial intelligence research responsible for recent achievements such as AlphaGo and autonomous driving. This course is focused on understanding the key concepts of Reinforcement Learning, including Markov Decision Processes, Planning, and Policy Gradient Methods. This course does not have a programming heavy workload. 

## Prerequisites:
- Minimum grade of C- or better in CMSC250 or MATH310

## Recommended:
- Proficiency in Python (numpy)
- Machine Learning (CMSC422)
- Calculus and Linear Algebra (MATH141, MATH240)
- Probability & Statistics (STAT400)

## Resources:
Sutton Book
Silver Course

## Grading: 
- 70% - Problem Sets
- 20% - Project 
- 10% - Attendance 

## Problem Sets
Since the course will introduce students to new topics that many will not have previous exposure to, it is essential that students complete a weekly problem set to ensure they understand key concepts of each weekâ€™s lecture. 

## Projects
We will be working on an in-class project of the simple Pong game, and build upon this example throughout the class (until Week 13). Since we will be working on this project together in class, no grade will be assigned, but students are responsible for understanding the underlying concepts, which will be used when developing the final project. 

The only project the students will code themselves is the final project, using OpenAI Gym. They can pick a game or simulation of their choosing, and we will approve based on feasibility and available resources. We will be holding office hours throughout the week(s) of the final project for assistance.

## Communication:
We will interact with students in-person during office hours and online via Piazza

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx">Office of Student Conduct</a>.

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu.
